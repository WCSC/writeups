# CCCamp 2015 CTF

Duck and I (along with others) played with the Milliways chaostreff. Binaries and such included in respective directories.

Note that I won't go over the basics of exploitation (like ROP or defeating ASLR). If you need to learn that, there are plenty of resources online that are better than I would write in a GitHub markdown file... Including my (currently unedited/crappy) ["bootcamp"](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B93dhxRIPRWzfjRJRFdYNVQ0OXlJOVBBclB0eFFBampVOUpsR0NtS0VRdFpmYnJlQWNaRWc&usp=sharing).
