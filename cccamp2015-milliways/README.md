# CCCamp 2015 CTF

Duck and I (along with others) played with the Milliways chaostreff. Binaries and such included in respective directories.

Note that I won't go over the basics of exploitation (like ROP or defeating ASLR). If you need to learn that, there are plenty of resources online that are better than I would write in a GitHub markdown file... Including my (currently unedited/crappy) ["bootcamp"](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B93dhxRIPRWzfjRJRFdYNVQ0OXlJOVBBclB0eFFBampVOUpsR0NtS0VRdFpmYnJlQWNaRWc&usp=sharing).

ropcalc was fun and easy. It's definitely worth doing if you want a toy x64 ROP challenge.

bitterman was the first one I did (and the most points), simply because it was at the top of the list in the "binaries" section. It turned out that bitterman was a harder version of another challenge, so I won't post the writeup for that other one (phobos, I think).
