# CSAW 2015 Exploit 25 "contacts"
Exploit script and some comments

## contacts_54f3188f64e548565bc1b87d7aa07427
This is the challenge binary.

## contacts_old
This is the original binary before CSAW fixed it. It's 64-bit but non-stripped. This is nice to throw into IDA to easily look at program flow. The other binary is 32-bit (easier to exploit) but stripped (harder to read in IDA).

## libc-hopeful.so.6
This is the libc version stolen from CSAW's server.
`objdump -T libc-hopeful.so.6` to see the function offsets in libc

## contacts2-local.py
This is my exploit script. It's somewhat messy and only slightly commented. It won't work for you since it has the wrong libc offsets for your computer, probably. You can possibly change it and get it working.
