`%08x%23$n`

or possibly 

`%08x%19$n'

It depends on how the thing gets compiled.


What this does:

%08x
This prints 8 hexadecimal characters from the first thing on the stack. 

Because we now have printer 8 characters, we can write out this number to pass the win/lose check

%23$n
This writes out to memory pointed to by the 23rd stack value. It writes the number of thus far printed characters (8)
