# Basic Printf Example
As part of my presentation during the WCSC meeting, I used this program to demo a basic printf exploit before leading in to the more difficult "contacts" challenge. 

## Usage
Run the compiled binary `./printf-example`

Enter in your "user name". Your goal is to exploit the fact that this string is directly printf'd by the program.

## Compilation
`gcc -m32 -std=gnu99 printf-example.c -o printf-example`

`-m32` tells gcc to compile as a 32-bit program instead of a 64-bit program. 32-bit is simpler to understand. You may need to install the ia32-libs package depending on your system setup. 

## Exploitation
I recommend using [GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) with [PEDA](https://github.com/longld/peda). I have a custom PEDA fork that I like because it adds more color/tabs to memory views. It's [here](https://github.com/duckythescientist/peda).

The solution is in `solution.txt` if you can't get it on your own.
