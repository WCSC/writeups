Sunshine CTF 2016
=================
Sunshine CTF is a ctf that was hosted at BSides Orlando in 2016 by members of the Hack@UCF club. The challenges were introductory level to mid level. 
There were a couple themes for the CTF but quite a few challenges were based on the TV show Rick and Morty.

I participated in this CTF originally with brad_d and bspar with help from und3rfl0w towards the end. The binaries were pretty introductory, being done without stack protection but there were some really cool RE challenges and some forensics stuff as well.

I solved one of the binaries and one of the recon challenges. I don't have the binary anymore though unfortunately.
