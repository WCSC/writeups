How I Solved It
---------------
Any _true_ Floridian has probably heard of the /r/Floridaman subreddit and those who follow it may recall a recent news story from
Jupiter, Florida (Palm Coast) involving one florida man tossing a live alligator through a Wendy's drive-thru.

If I'm honest, this flag was easy and at the same time was absolutely **_NOT_** easy. So yes, you are given a lot of information but aside
from the fact that it was on a florida news site, the other hints weren't available until near the end of the final day.

So with the drive-thru story in mind, my first instinct was to find a list of florida news site and craft google queries of the form 
`florida + man + alligator + driverthru site:<some news site>`. Honestly if I had known something about the terrible business practices of
news sites I would have found this much faster however it took me close to 16 hours from here. The reason being is that florida news sites like to grab multiple separate domains _and_ post the same exact news story multiple times, each with different comment sections.

There was a fake flag posted, which I happened to find at around midnight after the first day delerious and tired and I was not a happy camper. It was posted on a palmcoast news website, restricting google searches to that site eventually turned up this page `http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/news/crime-law/wendys-alligator-thrower-is-only-fulfilling-his-fl/nqNfr/` with only a single comment by Summerc137 with our real flag (Summerc137 being a reference to Summer from dimension c137 in Rick and Morty).

That's it, there is our flag.
