Sunshine CTF 2016
=================
Sunshine CTF is a ctf that was hosted at BSides Orlando in 2016 by members of the Hack@UCF club. The challenges were introductory level to mid level. 
There were a couple themes for the CTF but quite a few challenges were based on the TV show Rick and Morty.

The binaries were pretty introductory, being done without stack protection but there were some really cool Social Engineering challenges and some forensics stuff as well. We solved all the binaries and came in first place locally, so it went pretty great.
